-----------------------------------------------Welcome to our application----------------------------------------------

**Note: because the main purpose of this project is 
to help user understand how the algorithm works,
we put some restriction to our application:
  	1. Maximum number of page frame and page reference is 5 and 13 respectively.
  	2. We only implements 3 algorithms is FIFO, LRU and Optimal Page Replacement.


1. Tool bar (on the top of the screen):
* You can:
  	- Choose to see instruction via Help Button:

    - Exit the program via Exit Button, the program will show a dialog to confirm.

2. Input region (under the tool bar):
* From left to right:
	- A choice box to choose an algorithm
  
  	- A text field to enter the number of page frames
  	
  	- A text field to input the page reference string
  	
 	- A "Start" button to begin the demonstration.
 	
 3. Page Fault Field: display the number of page faults given the input.
